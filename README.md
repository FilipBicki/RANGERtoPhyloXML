# RANGERtoPhyloXML

This software is to be used after running RANGER-DTL <http://compbio.mit.edu/ranger-dtl/>. It converts the output into the recPhyloXML format <http://phylariane.univ-lyon1.fr/recphyloxml/>.

USAGE:

Run the script in terminal by using command py RANGERtorecPhyloXML.py 'RANGER-DTL output'. This is the default command behavior and it expects 'RANGER-DTL output' to be in the same directory as the script. The file name should be written without quotes and the output is placed in the same directory as 'output.xml'.

COMMANDS:

--help/-h command can be used as an argument after py RANGERtorecPhyloXML.py in order to list other commands.

--input/-i command to specify path to input file ie. py RANGERtorecPhyloXML.py -i C:\test.txt

--output/-o command to specify path to output file ie. py RANGERtorecPhyloXML.py -i C:\test.xml

This software was created by Filip Bicki as an independent study for the University of Connecticut.
